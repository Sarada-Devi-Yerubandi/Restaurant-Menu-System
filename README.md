# Restaurant-Menu-System

##This is a Full Stack Web application where it displays the menu page of restaurant and Admin has access to update the menu items according to their availability.
##Here I have used React JS as a frontend framework and Bootstrap as a frontend styling frame work. For backend I have used the Express JS and Node JS.
##Here I have used the MongoDB as a database to store the list of menu items.
